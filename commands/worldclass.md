# WorldClass — Quality Score Loop

You are running a world-class quality check. The task is: $ARGUMENTS

This command scores the code on two independent lenses (Architecture + Vibes), shows exactly where points are lost, and loops through remediation until the combined score reaches 95/100 or 3 cycles are exhausted.

---

## PHASE 0: SETUP

Run in the orchestrating session:

```
mkdir -p .autocode
```

Read `~/.claude/autocode/philosophy.md` in full. Capture as `PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY`.

**Invocation mode detection:**
If $ARGUMENTS starts with `Task #` (called by /task as `Task #001: description`): `MODE = "orchestrated"`. Extract TASK_NUM from the `#NNN` portion.
Otherwise: `MODE = "standalone"`. If $ARGUMENTS contains a task number (`#\d+` or bare integer): extract as TASK_NUM. If no task number found: TASK_NUM = nil.

If `scripts/deep-audit.sh` exists, run it on the changed files before scoring.
If `scripts/shipping-gate.sh` exists, run it on the changed directory before scoring.

Extract primary terms from $ARGUMENTS (nouns, verbs, domain concepts — e.g. "fix retry logic in SMS sender" → terms: retry, sms, sender).

Read `.autocode/patterns.md`. Count occurrences per category. Extract categories with 3+ occurrences and their 2 most recent descriptions. Capture as `KNOWN_DRIFTS`. If the file doesn't exist or no category reaches 3 occurrences: `KNOWN_DRIFTS = "None yet."`

Read `.autocode/reflections.md`. Search for entries whose task description contains any of the extracted terms. Take the 2 most recent matching entries verbatim. Capture as `REFLECTION_LOG`. If no matches found or file doesn't exist: `REFLECTION_LOG = "None yet."`

Read `.autocode/requirements.md`. Search for an entry whose task description matches $ARGUMENTS. If found, extract its Section 1 (Acceptance Criteria) verbatim. Capture as `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA`. If not found: `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA = "Not available."`

Read `.autocode/agents/security.md` → `MEMORY_SECURITY` (or "None").
Read `.autocode/agents/architect.md` → `MEMORY_ARCHITECT` (or "None").
Read `.autocode/agents/qa.md` → `MEMORY_QA` (or "None").
Read `.autocode/agents/cto.md` → `CTO_MEMORY` (or "None").
Extract known blind spots per agent from CTO_MEMORY as `CTO_INTELLIGENCE`.

**Step A — FULL_DIFF (history-aware diff)**

Run: `git log --oneline -10`

Check each commit message for terms matching $ARGUMENTS.
- If 1+ commits match: note the commit hash immediately BEFORE the first matching commit.
  Run: `git diff [that-hash]..HEAD`
  Note in context: "Diff spans N commits back to [hash]."
- If no commits match OR no `.git` directory exists:
  Run: `git diff HEAD` (uncommitted changes)
  If that is empty: `git diff HEAD~1` (last commit's changes)

Capture result as `FULL_DIFF`.

**Step B — TASK_SCOPE (full file contents)**

Run: `git diff [FULL_DIFF range] --name-only`

Filter out: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.min.js`, `*.d.ts`, `*.map`

Cap at 10 files. If more than 10: prioritize files named after task terms → files with most changed lines.

For each file:
- ≤300 lines: read in full
- >300 lines: read first 200 lines + last 50 lines. Insert at the break point: `[FILE TRUNCATED — N total lines. Showing first 200 + last 50.]`

Capture as:
```
TASK_SCOPE:
=== [filepath] (N lines[, TRUNCATED]) ===
[contents]
=== [filepath] ===
[contents]
[...repeat...]
```

If FULL_DIFF is empty and no files are identified: `TASK_SCOPE = "No changed files detected."`

**Step C — CALLER_CONTEXT (files that call into the changed code)**

For each changed file: extract the basename without extension (e.g., `sms-sender` from `apps/worker/src/sms-sender.ts`).

Run for each basename:
```
grep -r "from '.*[basename]'" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" -l .
grep -r "require.*[basename]" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" -l .
```

Exclude from results: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `.autocode/`, the changed file itself. Take the 3 closest results per file (prefer same directory, then parent, then sibling directories).

Deduplicate across all changed files. Cap total at 10 caller files. For each caller file: read the first 100 lines only.

If no callers found: `CALLER_CONTEXT = "No direct callers identified in codebase."`

Capture as:
```
CALLER_CONTEXT:
=== [filepath] (caller of [changed-file]) ===
[first 100 lines]
[...repeat...]
```

Do not spawn any scoring agent until FULL_DIFF, TASK_SCOPE, and CALLER_CONTEXT are all captured.

---

## PHASE 1: SCORE

Spawn scoring agents simultaneously: Agent 1 (Architecture) and Agent 2 (Vibes) always run. Agent V (Acceptance Criteria) runs if `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA ≠ "Not available."` — if not available, set `AC_RESULT: {"met": 0, "not_met": 0, "partial": 0, "verdict": "SKIPPED"}` and proceed with two agents only.

---

**Scoring Agent 1 — Architecture (60% weight)**

Spawn an independent agent with this prompt:

"You are a senior software architect scoring code quality. The task was: $ARGUMENTS

SLOW-CODING TOYOTA SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY — This is the complete standard you are scoring against:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

TASK SCOPE — Full current state of every file this task touched. Score the complete result, not just the delta:
[TASK_SCOPE]

CODE DIFF — What specifically changed (use this to understand intent and the boundary of the change):
[FULL_DIFF]

CALLER CONTEXT — Files that import or call into the changed code. Not changed themselves, but may be affected:
[CALLER_CONTEXT]

ARCHITECTURE AGENT MEMORY — Prior findings on this codebase. Check that past open findings are addressed:
[MEMORY_ARCHITECT]

CTO TEAM INTELLIGENCE — Known agent blind spots. Verify these explicitly:
[CTO_INTELLIGENCE]

Score this code on Architecture quality out of 100. Start at 100 and deduct points for every violation found.

Score against these dimensions:
- The 15 Rules (especially Rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15)
- Layer Cake Architecture (routes ≤150, services ≤400, utils ≤250, types ≤300 — no upward imports)
- Error Reference System (every catch block has a ref ID, no empty catch {})
- Anti-Patterns (catch {}, as any, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, organization.findFirst in worker, duplicated logic)
- Feature flags (every new feature gated)
- File headers (every new file has the required human-readable header)
- Seam tests (data crossing module boundaries has an integration test)
- Component truth (new React components have co-located .test.tsx)

For every deduction, state:
- Category (pick one: error-handling, tests, auth, security, data-loss, feature-flag, async, edge-case, code-quality, performance)
- Which rule or dimension
- Exactly what's wrong (file, line if visible, specific pattern)
- How many points deducted and why
- Severity on the 1–10 scale (1=trivial style, 5=medium fragile logic, 7=high real bug, 9=severe data loss)

Be ruthless. A score of 95+ means genuinely world-class — not just passing. A score of 80 means real problems exist. Do not give high scores to mediocre code.

Output your deductions list, then this line exactly:
ARCHITECTURE_SCORE: N"

Capture Agent 1's deductions and ARCHITECTURE_SCORE.

---

**Scoring Agent 2 — Vibes (40% weight)**

Spawn a second independent agent simultaneously with this prompt:

"You are a world-class engineer doing a gut-check review. The task was: $ARGUMENTS

SLOW-CODING TOYOTA SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY — Read this for context on the standards this codebase holds itself to:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

TASK SCOPE — Full current state of every file this task touched. Score the complete result, not just the delta:
[TASK_SCOPE]

CODE DIFF — What specifically changed (use this to understand intent and the boundary of the change):
[FULL_DIFF]

CALLER CONTEXT — Files that import or call into the changed code. Not changed themselves, but may be affected:
[CALLER_CONTEXT]

Score this code on Vibes quality out of 100. Start at 100 and deduct points for everything that makes you wince.

The vibes score is a fresh, honest read. Ask yourself:
- If I showed this to the best engineer I know, would they be quietly impressed or quietly disappointed?
- Does the code do what it claims to do?
- Is the naming honest — does every function name say what the function actually does?
- Would a non-technical person who inherited this in 5 years understand it?
- Is there anything clever that will confuse the next person?
- Does anything feel fragile, hacky, or held together with string?
- Are the tests testing real behavior, or are they just going through the motions?
- Does anything feel like it was written to look done rather than to be done?
- Apply the Five Forcing Functions: where was easy chosen over right?

The architecture score handles rule compliance. Your job is everything else — the feel, the honesty, the craft.

For every deduction, state:
- Category (pick one: error-handling, tests, auth, security, data-loss, feature-flag, async, edge-case, code-quality, performance)
- Exactly what made you wince (be specific, not 'this could be cleaner')
- How many points deducted and why
- Severity on the 1–10 scale (1=trivial style, 5=medium fragile logic, 7=high real bug, 9=severe data loss)

Do not be kind. A score of 95+ means this is genuinely excellent work. A score of 80 means real problems exist. Do not give high scores to mediocre code.

Output your deductions list, then this line exactly:
VIBES_SCORE: N"

Capture Agent 2's deductions and VIBES_SCORE.

---

**Scoring Agent V — Acceptance Criteria (independent gate)**

Skip this agent and use `AC_RESULT: {"met": 0, "not_met": 0, "partial": 0, "verdict": "SKIPPED"}` if `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA = "Not available."`

Otherwise, spawn a third independent agent simultaneously with this prompt:

"You are a requirements verifier. Do NOT judge code quality — other agents do that.
Your ONLY job: determine whether the built code actually satisfies the acceptance
criteria that were defined before building began.

Task: $ARGUMENTS

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
[ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA]

TASK SCOPE — full current state of built code:
[TASK_SCOPE]

CODE DIFF — what was changed:
[FULL_DIFF]

TOYOTA EVIDENCE RULE: For every acceptance criterion, your verdict MUST cite specific
evidence from the code. 'MET — looks correct' is INVALID. You must cite:
  - The file path and function/handler that implements the behavior
  - The test file path and test name that verifies the PASS CONDITION
  - The specific assertion in that test

You are FORBIDDEN from writing:
  - Any MET verdict without a file path AND a test name
  - 'The code appears to handle this'
  - 'MET — implementation looks complete'
  - Skipping any acceptance criterion

If you cannot find the code that satisfies a criterion, that criterion is NOT MET.
If you cannot find a test that verifies the PASS CONDITION, that criterion is PARTIALLY MET
at best, and you must say what test is missing.

---

For each acceptance criterion:

  AC[N]: [criterion text]
  VERDICT: MET / NOT MET / PARTIALLY MET
  IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE: [file:function] — [one sentence explaining what this code does]
  TEST EVIDENCE: [test-file:test-name] — [what assertion it makes that proves the PASS CONDITION]
  If NOT MET or PARTIALLY MET:
    MISSING: [exactly what implementation or test is absent]

---

Then output this line exactly:
AC_RESULT: {\"met\": N, \"not_met\": N, \"partial\": N, \"verdict\": \"PASS or FAIL\"}

verdict is PASS only if not_met = 0 AND partial = 0."

Capture Agent V's findings and AC_RESULT.

---

## PHASE 2: CALCULATE AND DECIDE

Once all scoring agents have responded, calculate in the orchestrating session:

```
COMBINED_SCORE = round((ARCHITECTURE_SCORE × 0.6) + (VIBES_SCORE × 0.4))
```

Print the full scorecard:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  WORLDCLASS SCORE — Cycle [N]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Architecture (60%):  [ARCHITECTURE_SCORE]/100
  Vibes        (40%):  [VIBES_SCORE]/100
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Combined:            [COMBINED_SCORE]/100
  Target:              95/100
  Acceptance Criteria: [N met]/[N total] — [PASS / FAIL / SKIPPED]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Architecture deductions:
[Agent 1's full deductions list]

Vibes deductions:
[Agent 2's full deductions list]

Acceptance Criteria findings:
[Agent V's full findings, or "SKIPPED — no requirements.md entry for this task"]
```

**Log deductions to `.autocode/patterns.md`:**

After printing the scorecard, log every deduction with severity ≥ 4 from both agents:

```
## [today's date] | Task: $ARGUMENTS — WorldClass cycle [N]
- [category] [description of deduction] — severity [N] (worldclass: -[N] pts)
```

Architecture deductions use the category the agent tagged. Vibes deductions use the category the agent tagged (usually `code-quality`). If `.autocode/patterns.md` does not exist, create it with `# AutoCode Patterns Log` header first.

---

## DECISION LOGIC

**If COMBINED_SCORE ≥ 95 AND AC_RESULT verdict = PASS (or SKIPPED):**

**Write agent memory updates:**
Append to `.autocode/agents/architect.md` → `## Past Findings — Resolved`: any architecture deductions from this cycle that scored < 95 in prior cycles but are now resolved.
Append to `.autocode/agents/qa.md` → `## Past Findings — Resolved`: any QA deductions that are now resolved.
Append to `.autocode/agents/security.md` → `## Past Findings — Resolved`: any security deductions now resolved.

Run the Documentation Gate (see below).

Append to `.autocode/worldclass-trends.md`:
```
| [today's date] | [first 60 chars of $ARGUMENTS] | [N cycles] | [COMBINED_SCORE] | PASS |
```
If `.autocode/worldclass-trends.md` does not exist, create it with this header first:
```
# WorldClass Score Trends
| Date | Task | Cycles | Final Score | Verdict |
|------|------|--------|-------------|---------|
```

Print:
```
✅ World-class.
Architecture: [N]/100 | Vibes: [N]/100 | Combined: [N]/100
Acceptance Criteria: [N met]/[N total] — [PASS / SKIPPED]
Task: $ARGUMENTS
```

WORLDCLASS_RESULT: {"score":[COMBINED_SCORE],"verdict":"PASS","cycles_run":N}
Stop. Control returns to /task (or to Max if run standalone).

**If COMBINED_SCORE ≥ 95 AND AC_RESULT verdict = FAIL:**

Print:
```
⚠️ Score is world-class but acceptance criteria failed.
Combined: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100 — AC FAIL: [not_met] not met, [partial] partial
```
Trigger the Remediation Plan Loop. Pass unmet/partial AC items as `UNMET_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA` to the plan agents.

**If COMBINED_SCORE < 95 AND fewer than 3 cycles have run:**

Print how many points need to close and which deductions account for the largest gap. Include any AC failures in the gap summary. Then trigger the Remediation Plan Loop below.

**If 3 cycles have been reached without hitting 95:**

Append to `.autocode/worldclass-trends.md`:
```
| [today's date] | [first 60 chars of $ARGUMENTS] | 3 | [COMBINED_SCORE] | MAX_CYCLES |
```

WORLDCLASS_RESULT: {"score":[COMBINED_SCORE],"verdict":"MAX_CYCLES","cycles_run":3}

**Write escalation brief to CTO memory:**

Read `.autocode/agents/cto.md`. Append to `## Open Escalations`:
```
### [today's date] | WorldClass — Task: $ARGUMENTS
Problem: [the top deduction category preventing 95 — not "quality issues"]
Cycles: 3 (maximum reached)
Score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100 | Gap: [95 - COMBINED_SCORE] points

Unresolved deductions:
[list deductions ≥ -3 pts from most recent scoring cycle]

Options:
A) Continue with targeted fix on [top deduction] — estimated 1 more cycle
B) Accept current score of [COMBINED_SCORE]/100 and proceed
C) Redesign [specific area] — eliminates [deduction category] permanently

Recommendation: [A/B/C] — [one sentence rationale]
Decision needed from: Max
```

Print:
```
⚠️ Max cycles reached.
Final score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100 (target: 95)
Escalation brief written to .autocode/agents/cto.md
Run /team-health to see the full escalation queue.

Outstanding deductions:
[list the remaining deductions from the most recent scoring cycle]
```

If `MODE = "standalone"` AND TASK_NUM is set:
  Open `.autocode/tasks.md`. Find the `### Task #[TASK_NUM]` block.
  Find the line immediately after the `**Owner:**` line.
  Remove any existing `**WorldClass deductions —` block if present.
  Insert:
    `**WorldClass deductions — [today's date]** ([95 - COMBINED_SCORE] pts from 95, [N] deductions pending fix):`
    For each deduction ≥ -2 pts from the most recent scoring cycle (Architecture and Vibes combined):
    `- [category] [description] — severity [N] (-[pts] pts)`
  Print:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    WorldClass: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100 (need 95). Deductions written to Task #[TASK_NUM].
    Send to the dev team to close the gap?

      yes → /task #[TASK_NUM] starts a fix cycle now
      no  → stop here, review deductions above first
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Wait for user input.
  If no: stop.
  If yes: run `/task #[TASK_NUM]`. Stop.

Stop.

---

## DOCUMENTATION GATE

Triggered after a PASS verdict (COMBINED_SCORE ≥ 95 AND AC_RESULT = PASS or SKIPPED). Non-blocking — control returns to caller regardless of DOCS_RESULT.

**Significance check:** Skip this gate if FULL_DIFF touches fewer than 3 files AND adds no new route, module, or feature flag change. Small bug fixes do not require documentation updates.

If significant, spawn a single agent:

"You are a documentation auditor. Your job: verify that the project's session-startup
documentation reflects what was just built.

Task that was completed: $ARGUMENTS

WHAT WAS BUILT:
[FULL_DIFF]

CURRENT CLAUDE.md (first 300 lines):
[first 300 lines of CLAUDE.md]

CURRENT STATUS.md (first 200 lines):
[first 200 lines of docs/STATUS.md]

THE TEST: If a new Claude Code session started right now, with no context except CLAUDE.md
and STATUS.md, would it know:
  1. That this feature exists and is live?
  2. What it does and any critical constraints?
  3. Any new modules, packages, or files added by this task?
  4. Any changes to the system architecture or data flow?

Apply this test literally. Do not assume context exists that isn't in the files above.

MANDATORY FORMAT:

DOCS CHECK — CLAUDE.md:
VERDICT: CURRENT / STALE
If STALE: [exact text that should be added, and which section it belongs in]

DOCS CHECK — STATUS.md:
VERDICT: CURRENT / STALE
If STALE: [exact text that should be added, and which section it belongs in]

DOCS_RESULT: {\"status\": \"CURRENT or STALE\", \"gaps\": N}

You are FORBIDDEN from:
  - Writing CURRENT without confirming the specific feature appears in the file by name
  - Writing 'documentation appears sufficient'
  - Skipping either file"

If DOCS_RESULT status = STALE, print:

```
DOCUMENTATION WARNING: [N] documentation gap(s) found.
The code has passed all quality gates. Update before the next session:
[gaps list with exact text to add and which section]
```

Log to `.autocode/patterns.md` under `documentation` category (severity 3).

Return control to caller regardless of DOCS_RESULT. If running standalone (not called by /task), run `/reflect $ARGUMENTS`.

---

## REMEDIATION PLAN LOOP

Triggered when COMBINED_SCORE < 95. Takes both agents' deduction lists as input. Four independent agents in sequence — no pause after the fourth, go straight to writing code.

**Agent 1 — Initial Remediation Plan**

Spawn an independent agent with this prompt:

"You are a senior software architect. Here are the quality deductions that must be addressed to reach world-class (95/100):

Architecture deductions (60% weight):
[Agent 1's deductions from most recent scoring cycle]

Vibes deductions (40% weight):
[Agent 2's deductions from most recent scoring cycle]

UNMET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA — These must also be satisfied. Address as first-priority fixes if any exist:
[AC_RESULT unmet/partial items from Agent V, or "None — AC was SKIPPED or all criteria MET"]

Current score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100. Need: 95/100. Gap: [95 - COMBINED_SCORE] points.

SLOW-CODING TOYOTA SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY — Every fix must comply with this:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

KNOWN DRIFTS — These categories have recurred 3+ times in previous runs on this codebase. Each fix must include a specific countermeasure — not a general acknowledgment:
[KNOWN_DRIFTS]

PAST REFLECTIONS ON RELATED TASKS — Domain-specific lessons from similar past work. Apply these directly — do not re-learn what is already known:
[REFLECTION_LOG]

Code diff for context:
[FULL_DIFF]

Put together a specific remediation plan. Prioritize deductions by point value — close the biggest gaps first. For each fix, be specific: which file, which line, exactly what to change, and why that change closes the deduction.

Do not write a theoretical plan. Write exactly what code to change so there is no room for drift.

Produce a detailed remediation plan."

Capture Agent 1's plan output.

**Agent 2 — Revision 1**

Spawn an independent agent with this prompt:

"You are a senior software architect doing a critical review. The task is: $ARGUMENTS

SLOW-CODING TOYOTA SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY — The standard this plan must meet:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

Here is a remediation plan just written to close a quality gap:

[Agent 1's plan]

Current score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100. Target: 95/100.

Is this plan specific enough? Does every fix actually close the deduction it claims to close? Are there any fixes that look good on paper but won't actually move the score?

Find the specific weaknesses, call them out explicitly, then rewrite the plan to fix them."

Capture Agent 2's revised plan output.

**Agent 3 — Revision 2**

Spawn an independent agent with this prompt:

"You are a senior software architect doing a critical review. The task is: $ARGUMENTS

SLOW-CODING TOYOTA SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY — The standard this plan must meet:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

Here is a remediation plan just written:

[Agent 2's plan]

Are any of the proposed tests pseudocode? Does every proposed fix actually address the root cause, or does it just mask the symptom? Will the vibes score actually improve, or are we only fixing mechanical rule violations?

Find the specific weaknesses, call them out explicitly, then rewrite the plan to fix them."

Capture Agent 3's revised plan output.

**Agent 4 — Final Pressure Test**

Spawn an independent agent with this prompt:

"You are a senior software architect doing a final pressure test. The task is: $ARGUMENTS

SLOW-CODING TOYOTA SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY — The standard this plan must meet:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

Here is a remediation plan just written:

[Agent 3's plan]

Current score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100. Target: 95/100.

After every fix in this plan is applied, will the code genuinely be world-class — or will the scoring agents still find problems? Are the vibes fixes real or cosmetic? Are the architecture fixes complete or partial?

Find the specific weaknesses, call them out explicitly, then produce the final remediation plan."

Capture Agent 4's final plan. Immediately proceed to the build phase — no pause.

---

## BUILD PHASE (after Remediation Plan Loop)

Implement Agent 4's remediation plan immediately. No pause.

- Write all fixes
- Write or update tests as needed
- Run tests — fix anything that fails before continuing
- If `scripts/deep-audit.sh` exists, run it on the changed files
- If `scripts/shipping-gate.sh` exists, run it on the changed directory

Do not proceed to re-scoring until tests are passing.

After tests pass, refresh task scope before the next scoring cycle:
Re-run Steps A, B, C to refresh FULL_DIFF, TASK_SCOPE, and CALLER_CONTEXT.
The remediation changed files — scoring agents must see the current state, not the pre-fix state.
Then return to PHASE 1.

---

## RULES

- Never round up scores — a 94.6 is not a 95
- Never skip a scoring cycle — the score must be re-earned, not assumed
- Never write a fix that doesn't address a specific deduction
- Both agents must score independently — never show Agent 2's prompt to Agent 1
- The combined score formula is always (Architecture × 0.6) + (Vibes × 0.4) — never deviate
- Log test failures to `.autocode/test-failures.md` using the same format as /autocode (Phase: WorldClass cycle N)
- If the gap to 95 is entirely in Vibes, the remediation plan must include real craft improvements — not just mechanical checklist fixes
- Never score without TASK_SCOPE and CALLER_CONTEXT captured — full file context is mandatory
- After every remediation build, refresh FULL_DIFF, TASK_SCOPE, and CALLER_CONTEXT before re-scoring
- AC_RESULT is an independent hard gate — COMBINED_SCORE ≥ 95 with AC_RESULT FAIL still triggers remediation
- Agent V must produce MET / NOT MET / PARTIALLY MET for every criterion with file:function AND test evidence — never "looks implemented"
- Documentation Gate is a warning, not a blocker — return control to caller regardless of DOCS_RESULT
- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA not available means Agent V skips — never invent acceptance criteria that weren't written before building
- FORBIDDEN from calling /reflect (caller handles it — /task calls /reflect; standalone mode calls it directly)
- Always emit WORLDCLASS_RESULT before stopping
