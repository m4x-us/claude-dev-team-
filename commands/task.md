# Task — CTO Orchestrator

You are the CTO orchestrating a complete task cycle. The task is: $ARGUMENTS

Parse TASK_NUM from $ARGUMENTS (e.g., "#003" or "3" → 3).
Execute every phase without pausing.

---

## PHASE 0: CTO CONTEXT

**Step 0.0 — Complexity check:**
Read `.autocode/tasks.md`. Find Task #TASK_NUM. Check for a `**Complexity: Direct**` line.

If found:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ⚡ Task #[TASK_NUM] is tagged DIRECT complexity.
  This was evaluated as a cosmetic or single-line fix when it
  was added to the task list. The full dev team (audit, worldclass,
  4 agents) will take 10× longer than handling it directly.

  Recommended: open a regular Claude session and fix it there.

  Continue with the full dev team anyway?  yes / no
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wait for user input. If no: stop. If yes: proceed to Step 0.1.

If Complexity: Full: proceed to Step 0.1 silently.

If no Complexity field:
  Run COMPLEXITY_EVAL on the task description:
  DIRECT if ALL: (a) ≤ 20 words, (b) contains a cosmetic keyword (typo/comment/rename/update text/fix label/add log/remove unused/clarify/whitespace/formatting), (c) contains none of: auth/security/database/migration/schema/api route/endpoint/feature flag/implement/integrate/webhook/redis/queue/worker/payment/order/multi-file.
  FULL otherwise (default when in doubt).
  Write `**Complexity: [Direct/Full]**` to the task entry in `.autocode/tasks.md` before the `**Owner:**` line.
  If Direct: show the warning above and wait for yes/no input.
  If Full: proceed to Step 0.1 silently.

**Step 0.1 — Read task definition:**
Read `.autocode/tasks.md`. Find Task #TASK_NUM.
Extract: TASK_DEFINITION (full block), DONE_WHEN ("Done when:" line), TASK_FILES ("File:" line).
If not found: "Task #N not found in .autocode/tasks.md" → stop.

If task status is COMPLETE: "Task #N is already marked complete. Run /audit #N to re-audit, or /tasks reopen #N first." Stop.

Also check the task block for a `**Audit findings —` or `**WorldClass deductions —` line. If either is found, extract all bullet lines beneath it as PENDING_FINDINGS. If both exist, combine them. These are findings from a prior standalone /audit or /worldclass run — treat them as the cycle history so the build agent knows exactly what to fix.

**Step 0.2 — Read cycle log:**
Read `.autocode/agents/cto.md`. In `## Task Cycle Log`, find entry for Task #TASK_NUM.
CYCLE_HISTORY = all cycle entries found (or "None — first cycle").
AUDIT_CYCLE = 1. (Session variable — resets to 1 every time /task is invoked. Re-running /task #N always gives a fresh 5 audit attempts regardless of prior history.)
WC_CYCLE = 0. (Session variable — resets to 0 every time /task is invoked. Re-running /task #N always gives a fresh 5 WC attempts.)
CURRENT_CYCLE = AUDIT_CYCLE.
Note: CYCLE_HISTORY is still read from cto.md for failure mode diagnosis (Step 0.5) — historical context helps the build agent avoid repeating past mistakes. But the escalation caps are per-session only.

**Step 0.3 — Read agent memories:**
MEMORY_SECURITY ← `.autocode/agents/security.md` (or "None")
MEMORY_ARCHITECT ← `.autocode/agents/architect.md` (or "None")
MEMORY_QA ← `.autocode/agents/qa.md` (or "None")
PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY ← `~/.claude/autocode/philosophy.md` (warn if missing)

**Step 0.4 — Escalation pre-check:**
If AUDIT_CYCLE > 5: trigger ESCALATION (reason: CYCLE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED). Note: WC_CYCLE is not counted here — WorldClass quality loops are uncapped.
If any finding in CYCLE_HISTORY is annotated "ESCALATE": trigger ESCALATION (reason: REPEATED_FINDING).
If severity trended UP in 3 consecutive prior cycles: trigger ESCALATION (reason: SEVERITY_ESCALATING).
If "New findings introduced" > "Fixed this cycle" for 2 consecutive prior cycles: trigger ESCALATION (reason: REGRESSION_PATTERN).
Otherwise proceed to Step 0.5.

**Step 0.5 — Failure mode diagnosis for code failures (skip if first cycle):**

If CYCLE_HISTORY = "None — first cycle": skip this step. Set `TARGETED_GUIDANCE_MAP = "None"`.

Note: "Appears To" Drift, Philosophy Drift, and Severity Rationalization are handled in /audit.md at Agent C output time — they never appear in the cycle log. This step handles only CODE-level failure modes detectable from the cycle log summary.

Parse CYCLE_HISTORY for structured finding lines. Format: `[Fid|sev:N|category|file:function:line|description|annotation]`

**For each finding whose annotation segment = `REPEATED FROM CYCLE N`** (extract N):

1. Locate the matching finding from Cycle N-1 — same `description` text (first 50 chars, case-insensitive) in the Cycle N-1 structured log.
2. Extract `file:function` from both the current entry and the Cycle N-1 entry (4th pipe-delimited segment, before the colon-separated line number).
3. Map to failure mode:

**Surface Fix** — `file` OR `function` changed between current cycle and Cycle N-1 (same description, different location → symptom moved, root cause untouched)

**Pseudocode Tests** — `category` = "tests" AND `description` segment contains any of: "toBeDefined / toBeTruthy / toBeNull / not.toBeNull / .exist( / existence" (test exists but asserts nothing real)

**For each finding in "New findings introduced:" field** (these are NEW findings in files outside TASK_FILES):
Extract `file` from `[Fid|...|file:function:line|...]` — take the portion before the first `:` in segment 4.
If that `file` is NOT in TASK_FILES → **Scope Creep Regression**

**Fallback for old-format cycle log entries** (written before this structured format was adopted):
If CYCLE_HISTORY contains no structured `[Fid|...]` lines at all, fall back to prose-scan:
- Surface Fix: same finding text but different file:line mentioned
- Pseudocode Tests: finding mentions tests + any of "defined/truthy/exist/toBeDefined"
- Scope Creep Regression: "New findings introduced" field names a file not in TASK_FILES

---

**For each Surface Fix finding** — spawn a diagnostic agent:

"You are a senior software architect. The same audit finding has appeared across multiple cycles despite developer fixes. Diagnose why.

PHILOSOPHY: [PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY]

REPEATED FINDING across N cycles: [finding text]
WHAT WAS TRIED each cycle: [build approach entries from CYCLE_HISTORY]
FILE:LINE IN PRIOR CYCLES: [extract from findings annotations if available]

Diagnose the root cause — which of these patterns applies:
- Surface Fix: symptom addressed but root cause layer missed (e.g., route-level fix for middleware-layer problem)
- Scope Miss: fix applied at wrong architectural boundary
- Pseudocode Test Fix: test file added but assertions check existence not behavior
- Regression: prior fix broke adjacent code that re-introduces the issue

Output exactly:
DIAGNOSIS: [Surface Fix | Scope Miss | Pseudocode Test Fix | Regression]
ROOT_CAUSE: [one sentence — name specific file and function if determinable]
TARGETED_GUIDANCE: [file:function:line — specific change required. If location cannot be determined, write CONFIDENCE: LOW and explain why]
CONFIDENCE: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW"

---

**For each Pseudocode Tests finding** — spawn a diagnostic agent:

"You are a test quality specialist. An audit cycle found tests that are pseudocode — they exist but assert existence rather than behavior.

REPEATED FINDING: [finding text]
CYCLE HISTORY — what test changes were made: [build approach entries from CYCLE_HISTORY that mention tests]

For each test identified as pseudocode:
1. State the weak assertion pattern (expect(x).toBeDefined() / expect(x).toBeTruthy() / expect(x).not.toBeNull() — without asserting a specific value)
2. State what MUST be asserted instead — the specific return value, state change, error thrown, or side effect that proves the behavior works
3. Produce the corrected assertion:

PSEUDOCODE_FINDING: [test name] in [file:line]
  Weak assertion: [current assertion]
  Required behavioral assertion: [what must change]
  Corrected THEN clause: [exact assertion code — this test MUST FAIL if the behavior is broken]

TARGETED_GUIDANCE: Rewrite [test name]::[assertion] to [exact behavioral check]. This test must fail when [specific condition that represents the bug being absent]."

---

**For Scope Creep Regression** — no diagnostic agent. Inject directly into TARGETED_GUIDANCE_MAP:

```
SCOPE_LOCK_MANDATE — Prior cycle introduced regressions outside TASK_FILES. Hard lock active for this cycle.
LOCKED FILES (changes ONLY permitted here): [TASK_FILES from task definition]
Any change to a file outside LOCKED FILES requires this exact line at the TOP of the plan, before any implementation steps:
  SCOPE_EXPANSION_REQUEST: [file] — [why the finding's root cause cannot be fixed within LOCKED FILES] — [specific finding this addresses]
The CTO will evaluate scope expansions. A plan that changes files outside LOCKED FILES without this line is REJECTED.
```

---

Capture all diagnostic agent outputs as TARGETED_GUIDANCE_MAP. Each entry replaces the generic ANTI-LOOP MANDATE for its specific finding in the next build cycle.

Print:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  /task #[TASK_NUM] — Cycle [CURRENT_CYCLE]
  [TASK_DEFINITION first line]
  [If diagnoses ran]: CTO diagnosis: [N] failure modes mapped — targeted guidance ready
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## PHASE 1: BUILD

**Step 1.1 — Assemble build context and call /autocode:**
Run `/autocode` with $ARGUMENTS set to:

```
WORLDCLASS_MANDATE:
You are writing production code that must last 10 years and be maintained by people who never wrote it. These 8 standards are the lens through which you write every line — not a post-build checklist:

1. FAILURE MODES FIRST — Before any function: name its 3 failure modes. Write those handlers first, then the happy path. Bolted-on error handling is always shallow.

2. HONEST NAMES — Every function name is a promise. Does this code fully keep it? getUser() that increments a counter is lying. saveOrder() that silently returns null is lying. Rename or split until names are true.

3. VALIDATE AT BOUNDARIES — For every HTTP route, DB call, external API, queue consumer: validate at the entry point before any logic. Everything crossing a boundary is untrusted.

4. BEHAVIOR TESTS — Every test must answer: would this catch a silent regression? Test the rejection case, the null case, the concurrent case. Testing that a function was called is not a behavior test.

5. CLOSE EVERY ASYNC PATH — For every await: what happens if it rejects? Never resolves? Two run concurrently? Async with no failure path is a delayed crash.

6. HONEST TYPES — Return types must include null/error where possible. No as-any at boundaries. Optimistic typing creates silent production failures.

7. TRUE STATE — Variable names must match values at all times. isLoading: false during a fetch is a lie. error: null after swallowing an error is a lie.

8. EARN EVERY ABSTRACTION — Extract only when logic appears 3+ places or hides genuine complexity. If removing the abstraction clarifies the code, inline it.

PROJECT_PRINCIPLES:
[PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY — or "None — philosophy.md not found. Run /patterns to graduate learnings when ready."]

TASK_DEFINITION:
[TASK_DEFINITION full block]

CYCLE_HISTORY:
[If PENDING_FINDINGS exists: prepend the following before CYCLE_HISTORY]
STANDALONE AUDIT FINDINGS — fix all of these this cycle:
[PENDING_FINDINGS bullet list]
---
[CYCLE_HISTORY from cto.md — or "None — first cycle"]

DONE_WHEN:
[DONE_WHEN verbatim]

AGENT_MEMORIES:
Security: [MEMORY_SECURITY first 200 lines]
Architect: [MEMORY_ARCHITECT first 200 lines]
QA: [MEMORY_QA first 100 lines]

TARGETED_GUIDANCE_MAP:
[TARGETED_GUIDANCE_MAP entries, or "None — first cycle"]
```

**Step 1.2 — Read BUILD_RESULT:**
If BUILD_RESULT.status = "FAIL":
- Write CYCLE LOG ENTRY (see section below) with Scripts: FAIL
- Increment CURRENT_CYCLE. If > 5: trigger ESCALATION.
- Return to Step 1.1.

If BUILD_RESULT.status = "PASS": proceed to Step 1.3.

**Step 1.3 — Done When verification:**
Run DONE_WHEN mechanically:
- Contains a grep command: run it, check exit code
- References a test name: run the test
- Describes file state: check the file
- Describes UI behavior that genuinely cannot be verified in a terminal (visual layout, animation, hover state): mark DEFERRED, proceed. Note: "the feature works" is NOT UI behavior — run any grep, test, or file check that can prove it mechanically.

If DONE_WHEN FAILS: treat as severity-6 finding labeled "DONE_WHEN_FAIL: [condition] — [evidence]".
Inject into /audit via DONE_WHEN_FINDING.

If DONE_WHEN PASSES or DEFERRED: proceed to Phase 2.

---

## PHASE 2: AUDIT

**Step 2.1 — Call /audit:**
Run `/audit #[TASK_NUM]` with $ARGUMENTS set to:

```
TASK_DEFINITION:
[TASK_DEFINITION]

FULL_DIFF_OVERRIDE: [BUILD_RESULT.changed_files]

CYCLE_HISTORY:
[CYCLE_HISTORY — full prior log for this task, including this cycle's build approach]

[if Done When failed: DONE_WHEN_FINDING: DONE_WHEN_FAIL: [condition] — [evidence]]
```

**Step 2.2 — Read AUDIT_RESULT_FINAL:**
If verdict = "PASS":
- Capture as `FINAL_AUDIT_RESULT` in session context — hold this variable through Phase 3 and Phase 4 for memory writes. Do not discard it.
- Proceed to Phase 3.

If verdict = "FAIL" or "MAX_CYCLES":
- Check escalation triggers: any finding annotated "ESCALATE"? CURRENT_CYCLE ≥ 5? Severity trending UP 3 cycles? Regression pattern 2 consecutive cycles?
  → Yes to any: trigger ESCALATION.
- Write CYCLE LOG ENTRY (see section below).
- Increment CURRENT_CYCLE. Return to Phase 1 Step 1.1.

---

## CYCLE LOG WRITE

After each failed cycle, append to `.autocode/agents/cto.md` `## Task Cycle Log`.

Find or create task header:
```
### Task #[TASK_NUM] | [TASK_DEFINITION first line]
Status: In Progress | Cycle [CURRENT_CYCLE] | Started: [date of first cycle]
```

Compose cycle entry text:
```
#### Cycle [CURRENT_CYCLE] — [today's date]
Build approach: [specific file:function:line from /autocode planning summary — "added error handling" is REJECTED]
Scripts: [PASS / FAIL]
Audit findings (structured):
  [F{id}|sev:{severity}|{category}|{file}:{function}:{line}|{description}|{annotation}]
  [repeat one line per finding from AUDIT_RESULT_FINAL.findings — emit every finding]
Fixed this cycle: [comma-separated ids — findings from prior cycle no longer in AUDIT_RESULT_FINAL.findings, e.g. "F002, F003"]
Still open: [comma-separated ids — findings present this cycle AND in a prior cycle, e.g. "F001"]
New findings introduced: [comma-separated ids with file — findings annotated NEW whose file is NOT in TASK_FILES, e.g. "F004 (apps/web/src/lib/other.ts)"]
Regression signal: [YES if count(New findings introduced) > count(Fixed this cycle), else NO]
CTO diagnosis run: [YES with failure modes: [list], or NO — first cycle]
```

**Before appending to cto.md, validate the entry:**
Write the cycle entry text to `/tmp/cycle_entry_$$.txt`, then:

If `scripts/validate-cycle-log.sh` exists:
```
bash scripts/validate-cycle-log.sh /tmp/cycle_entry_$$.txt
```
- Exit 0: valid — append to cto.md.
- Exit 1: Cycle log entry is malformed. Print every `CYCLE_LOG_ERROR:` line. Fix all errors before writing. Do NOT write an invalid cycle log — an unvalidated log corrupts Step 0.5 failure mode detection in the next cycle.

If `scripts/validate-cycle-log.sh` does NOT exist: manually verify all 8 required fields are present and Build approach contains file:function before writing.

Then append the validated entry to `.autocode/agents/cto.md` `## Task Cycle Log`.

**Precision requirement:** "Build approach" MUST name specific file:function. Vague entries like "added error handling" are invalid and must be re-requested from /autocode planning output.

**Structured findings format — one line per finding:**
`[F001|sev:7|auth|apps/web/src/app/api/orders/route.ts:GET:47|Missing tenant isolation|NEW]`
Fields: id | severity with sev: prefix | category | file:function:line | description | annotation
This format is machine-parseable by Step 0.5 in the NEXT cycle. Descriptions with `|` chars were already blocked by validate-findings.sh (or prose fallback) so no escaping is needed.

---

## PHASE 3: WORLDCLASS

Run: `/worldclass Task #[TASK_NUM]: [TASK_DEFINITION first line]`
Wait for WORLDCLASS_RESULT.

If WORLDCLASS_RESULT.verdict = "PASS": proceed to Phase 4.

If WORLDCLASS_RESULT.verdict = "MAX_CYCLES":
  The task is not done. Pay the WorldClass tax now — deferring compounds debt.

  **Step 3.1 — Write deductions to tasks.md:**
  Open `.autocode/tasks.md`. Find the `### Task #[TASK_NUM]` block.
  Find the line immediately after the `**Owner:**` line.
  Remove any existing `**WorldClass deductions —` block if present.
  Insert:
    `**WorldClass deductions — [today's date]** ([95 - COMBINED_SCORE] pts from 95, [N] deductions pending fix):`
    For each unresolved deduction from the final WorldClass scoring cycle (≥ -2 pts, both Architecture and Vibes):
    `- [category] [description] — severity [N] (-[pts] pts)`

  **Step 3.2 — Inject into CYCLE_HISTORY:**
  Append to the in-session CYCLE_HISTORY variable:
  "WORLDCLASS DEDUCTIONS — fix all of these before this task can close:
  [same deduction list]"

  **Step 3.3 — Write cycle log entry:**
  Append to `.autocode/agents/cto.md` `## Task Cycle Log` under Task #[TASK_NUM]:
    `#### WC Cycle [WC_CYCLE + 1] — [today's date] — WorldClass MAX_CYCLES`
    `Build approach: WorldClass remediation — [top deduction category] was the blocking gap`
    `Scripts: PASS (audit passed; WorldClass did not reach 95)`
    `WorldClass score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100 | Gap: [95 - COMBINED_SCORE] pts`
    `Unresolved deductions: [top 3 by point value]`
    `Fixed this cycle: — | Still open: WorldClass gap`
    `New findings introduced: — | Regression signal: NO`
    `CTO diagnosis run: NO — WorldClass quality gap, not a repeated audit finding`

  **Step 3.4 — Increment WC_CYCLE and check session cap:**
  Increment WC_CYCLE. Do NOT increment AUDIT_CYCLE.

  If WC_CYCLE >= 5:
    WorldClass has not reached 95 after 5 attempts this session. Stop looping.
    Print:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      WorldClass hit 5 attempts this session. Current score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100.
      Deductions remain on Task #[TASK_NUM] in tasks.md.

      Run /task #[TASK_NUM] again for a fresh 5 attempts.
      Or accept current score and close the task? yes / no
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Wait for user input.
    If yes: proceed to Phase 4 (mark complete at current score).
    If no: stop. Task stays open. Run /task #[TASK_NUM] again when ready.

  If WC_CYCLE < 5: return to Phase 1 Step 1.1. The build agent receives the WorldClass deductions via CYCLE_HISTORY and must fix them before the audit re-runs.

---

## PHASE 4: COMPLETE

**Step 4.0 — Write agent memories (using FINAL_AUDIT_RESULT from Phase 2.2):**

Route FINAL_AUDIT_RESULT.findings to the correct memory file by `category`:
- category in ["security", "auth"] → `.autocode/agents/security.md`
- category in ["code-quality", "async", "error-handling", "feature-flag", "performance"] → `.autocode/agents/architect.md`
- category in ["tests", "requirements", "edge-case"] → `.autocode/agents/qa.md`

For each memory file M with at least one routed finding:

**If `scripts/update-memory.py` exists** (machine-enforced deduplication):

Build the JSON array of findings routed to M. Run:
```
python3 scripts/update-memory.py \
  --findings '[JSON array of findings routed to this memory file]' \
  --memory-file [M path]
```
- Exit 0: prints "OK: N added, N updated, N recurred" — memory file updated.
- Exit 1: prints MEMORY_ERROR — investigate and fix before proceeding.

**If `scripts/update-memory.py` does NOT exist** (graceful fallback):

For each finding F routed to M:
1. Read M. Search for existing entry where description[:50].lower() matches F.description[:50].lower() AND file = F.file AND function = F.function.
2. Match found (status: open) → update last-seen + increment occurrences.
3. Match found (status: resolved) → move back to open, add RECURRED note.
4. No match → append new entry.

Note: No resolved sweep. A finding absent from this audit may simply not have been in scope for this task. Automatic resolution would corrupt memory for findings from other tasks. Findings accumulate until a task explicitly confirms they are fixed across multiple audit cycles.

Print: "Agent memories updated — security ([N] open), architect ([N] open), qa ([N] open)."

**Step 4.1 — Ask Max before closing:**

Print:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Task #[TASK_NUM] passed audit. WorldClass: [score]/100 | Cycles: [N]
  Mark it complete and start the next task?

    yes → mark #[TASK_NUM] complete, start next task
    no  → leave #[TASK_NUM] open, stop here
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Wait for user input.

If **no**: stop. Task remains In Progress.

If **yes**:

  **Step 4.1a — Carry-Forward Gate:**

  Read the `**WorldClass deductions —**` block from the current task entry in `.autocode/tasks.md`. Extract all deduction lines with severity ≥ 4. If no such block exists, or no lines with severity ≥ 4 are found: skip this step entirely and proceed to /reflect.

  If 4 or more severity ≥ 4 deductions exist, print first:
  `⚠️ [N] carry-forwards from a single task — consider whether task scope was too broad.`

  Present to Max:
  ```
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    CARRY-FORWARD GATE — [N] gaps from Task #[TASK_NUM]
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    WorldClass score: [COMBINED_SCORE]/100

    [1] CARRY-FORWARD | severity [N] | [category]: [description] (-[N] pts)
    [2] CARRY-FORWARD | severity [N] | [category]: [description] (-[N] pts)
    ...

    All severity ≥ 4 items default to CARRY-FORWARD (added to end of Batch [N]).
    Override any item before continuing:
      debt [N] [reason]  → ACCEPTED-DEBT (logged to debt.md, requires reason)
      ok                 → accept all defaults and continue
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ```

  Wait for input. Process overrides.

  For each CARRY-FORWARD item:
  - Determine NEXT_NUM: find the highest `### Task #` number in `.autocode/tasks.md` and increment by 1 per new task
  - Find the last `### Task #` entry in the current `## Batch [N]` section (the batch containing Task #[TASK_NUM])
  - Insert a new task block immediately after it (before any `## Batch [N+1]` header):
    ```
    ### Task #[NEXT_NUM]
    **Carry-Forward from Task #[TASK_NUM] — [original task title, first line only]**
    Resolve the [category] WorldClass gap: [exact deduction description]. Target: eliminate the -[N]pt deduction.
    **Complexity: Direct**
    **Owner:** [same owner as Task #[TASK_NUM]]
    **File:** [same file(s) as Task #[TASK_NUM]]
    **Added:** Carry-forward — [today's date] — WorldClass score was [COMBINED_SCORE]/100
    ```
  - Append to `.autocode/carry-forward-log.md` (create with header `# Carry-Forward Log\n| Date | Source Task | CF Task | Category | Description | Severity |\n|------|------------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|` if not exists):
    `| [today's date] | Task #[TASK_NUM] | Task #[NEXT_NUM] | [category] | [description] | [severity] |`

  For each ACCEPTED-DEBT item:
  - Append to `.autocode/debt.md` (create with header `# Accepted Technical Debt\n| Date | Source Task | Category | Description | Severity | Reason |\n|------|------------|---------|-------------|---------|---------|` if not exists):
    `| [today's date] | Task #[TASK_NUM] | [category] | [description] | [severity] | [reason provided] |`

  Print: `✓ Carry-forward: [N] task(s) added to end of Batch [N] (#[NUM1], #[NUM2], ...) | Accepted debt: [N] item(s) logged`

  Run: `/reflect Task #[TASK_NUM]: [TASK_DEFINITION first line]`
  Edit `.autocode/tasks.md`: add `**Status: COMPLETE — [today's date]**` below Task #TASK_NUM Owner line.
  If a `**Audit findings —` or `**WorldClass deductions —` block exists in this task: remove it — findings are resolved.
  Update cto.md Task Cycle Log: change `Status: In Progress | Cycle N` → `Status: COMPLETE | Cycle N | Completed: [today's date]`
  Proceed to Step 4.2.

**Step 4.2 — Patterns graduation check:**
If `scripts/check-patterns-threshold.sh` exists:
Run: `bash scripts/check-patterns-threshold.sh .autocode/patterns.md`
- Exit 0: no threshold crossed — task cycle complete.
- Exit 1: one or more finding categories have crossed the graduation threshold (3+ occurrences, avg severity ≥ 6).
  Print to Max:
  ```
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    PATTERNS THRESHOLD CROSSED
    [paste script output verbatim]

    Recurring findings are ready to become Rules.
    Run: /patterns   (you decide yes/no on each proposed Rule)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ```
  Do NOT auto-run /patterns. Signal to Max, let Max decide.
- Script not found: skip silently.

**Step 4.3 — Batch completion survey:**

Read `.autocode/tasks.md`. Find which `## Batch N` section contains `Task #[TASK_NUM]`.

Count all `### Task #` entries in that batch section.
Count how many have `**Status: COMPLETE` in their block.

If ALL tasks in the batch are COMPLETE:
  Run: `/team-health scan batch-[BATCH_NUM]-complete`

  The survey updates `.autocode/map.md` with the current state of all three layers (pieces, modules, app). If the survey output includes PROPOSED ADDITIONS: review them and add any with severity ≥ 5 to the next BACKLOG batch in `.autocode/tasks.md`.

  Before writing each proposed task, run COMPLEXITY_EVAL on its description:
  DIRECT if ALL: (a) ≤ 20 words, (b) contains a cosmetic keyword (typo/comment/rename/update text/fix label/add log/remove unused/clarify/whitespace/formatting), (c) contains none of: auth/security/database/migration/schema/api route/endpoint/feature flag/implement/integrate/webhook/redis/queue/worker/payment/order/multi-file.
  FULL otherwise (default when in doubt).
  Write `**Complexity: Direct**` or `**Complexity: Full**` on each task entry before the Owner line.

  Note each added task: "Added by layer survey — Batch [N] complete — [today's date]".

  Print:
  ```
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    BATCH [N] COMPLETE — Layer survey run.
    Map updated: .autocode/map.md
    Next: /task #[next open task number]
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ```

If not all tasks in the batch are COMPLETE: skip silently — survey fires only at full batch boundaries.

**Step 4.4 — Post-completion triage:**

Runs immediately after Step 4.3 — whether or not a batch just completed. Three passes over all non-COMPLETE tasks. The just-completed task's TASK_DEFINITION is the reference for Passes 1 and 2.

**Pass 1 — Label audit (mechanical):**

Scan every non-COMPLETE task in `.autocode/tasks.md`. For each:
- If no `**Complexity:**` field: run COMPLEXITY_EVAL (same rule as Step 4.3). Write `**Complexity: Direct**` or `**Complexity: Full**` before the `**Owner:**` line.
- If `**Complexity: Full**` but the description is now ≤ 20 words: re-run COMPLEXITY_EVAL. If it qualifies as Direct, update the label and add a note below `**Owner:**`: `**Label updated:** Full → Direct — [today's date] — [one-line reason]`

Do not upgrade Direct → Full based on description length alone — only downgrade.

**Pass 2 — Obsolescence and scope sweep (judgment):**

For each non-COMPLETE task, compare its description against what Task #[TASK_NUM] actually shipped:

- **Fully redundant** — the completed task shipped the same fix at the same location (same file, same function, same defect class): mark COMPLETE with `**Status: COMPLETE — [today's date] — Resolved by Task #[TASK_NUM]: [one sentence why]**`
- **Scope reduced** — the completed task addressed part of this open task (e.g., refactored the module this task was going to refactor, making the remaining work narrower): narrow the task description to only what remains, re-run COMPLEXITY_EVAL on the updated description, update the label if it changed. Add: `**Scope narrowed:** [today's date] — [what was already addressed by Task #[TASK_NUM]]`
- **Unaffected** — no overlap: leave as-is, no annotation

Print only if anything changed in Pass 1 or 2:
```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TRIAGE — after Task #[TASK_NUM]
  Labels written: [N] (tasks that had no Complexity field)
  Labels updated: [N] (Full → Direct)
  Resolved by completion: Task #NNN — [reason]
  Scope narrowed: Task #NNN — [what changed]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
If nothing changed in either pass: silent.

**Pass 3 — Priority reorder (CTO discretion):**

Read all non-COMPLETE tasks from `.autocode/tasks.md` (across all batches). Read the current survey output (from Step 4.3 if it ran, or `.autocode/map.md` if it exists), agent memories, and AUDIT_TRENDS.

**Priority reasoning — apply in this order:**

1. **Dependency lock:** A task cannot move before any task it is "Blocked by." This is a hard constraint — never violated.

2. **Elevation triggers** (move task to an earlier batch):
   - Task addresses a gap just found by the layer survey (piece, module, or E2E gap flagged this cycle)
   - Task is security or auth category AND a security finding appeared in the most recent audit
   - Task has severity ≥ 8 AND is not in the current sprint batch
   - A pattern in `.autocode/patterns.md` directly implicates this task's file or module

3. **Demotion triggers** (move task to a later batch):
   - Task has severity ≤ 3 AND nothing blocks it AND nothing depends on it
   - Task addresses a module the survey just confirmed is healthy (good coverage, integration test exists)
   - Task is a documentation or polish task when critical security or QA gaps are open

4. **Default:** If no trigger applies, leave the task where it is. Do not reorder for its own sake.

**How to reorder:**
- Move tasks by changing which `## Batch N` section they appear in within tasks.md.
- Task numbers are NEVER changed — #007 stays #007 regardless of which batch it's in.
- Batch headers (theme, dependency statement) must be updated if the composition changes significantly.
- If a task moves, add a one-line note below its `**Owner:**` line: `**Moved:** Batch [from] → Batch [to] — [one sentence reason] — [today's date]`

**Print only if anything moved:**
```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  PRIORITY REORDER — [N] task(s) moved
  Task #NNN: Batch X → Batch Y — [reason]
  Task #NNN: Batch X → Batch Y — [reason]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If nothing moved: print nothing. The reorder is silent when the list is already in the right order.

**Step 4.5 — Start next task:**

Scan `.autocode/tasks.md` top to bottom. Find the first `### Task #` block that does NOT contain `**Status: COMPLETE`. That is NEXT_TASK_NUM.

If NEXT_TASK_NUM found: run `/task #[NEXT_TASK_NUM]`.

If no open tasks remain:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  All tasks complete. Run /team-health to see the full picture.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ESCALATION

Append to `.autocode/agents/cto.md` `## Open Escalations`:
```
### [today's date] | Task #[TASK_NUM]: [TASK_DEFINITION first line]
Trigger: [CYCLE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED / REPEATED_FINDING: "[text]" in cycles N,N-1,N-2 / SEVERITY_ESCALATING / REGRESSION_PATTERN]
Cycles run: [N]
Unresolved findings (severity ≥ 5):
[list from most recent audit]

Cycle history summary:
[one line per cycle: what was tried, what audit found]

Options:
A) Continue with focused fix on [specific blocker] — estimated N more cycles
B) Accept current state with monitoring: [specific monitoring plan for unresolved finding]
C) Redesign [specific component that unresolved finding lives in]

Recommendation: [A/B/C] — [one sentence rationale]
Decision needed from: Max
```

Print:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ESCALATION — Task #[TASK_NUM]
  Trigger: [reason]
  Cycles run: [N]
  Unresolved: [top 3 findings]

  Escalation brief written to .autocode/agents/cto.md
  Run /team-health to see the full escalation queue.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Stop. Do not call /reflect on escalated tasks.

## RULES

- FORBIDDEN from writing code directly — all code changes go through /autocode
- FORBIDDEN from making code quality judgments — that is /audit's job
- FORBIDDEN from skipping the BUILD GATE — BUILD_RESULT PASS required before calling /audit
- FORBIDDEN from skipping Done When verification — run it or mark DEFERRED, never omit
- FORBIDDEN from closing a cycle log without "Fixed this cycle" and "Still open" fields
- FORBIDDEN from calling /reflect on escalated tasks
- Escalate on trigger conditions — do not absorb and keep cycling
- Cycle log is permanent — write it honestly even when nothing was fixed
- "Build approach" in the cycle log MUST include specific file:function:line — reject vague entries
